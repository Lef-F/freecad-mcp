## Legal Basis

| Act/Rule | Section | Subject |
|----------|---------|---------|
| PBL 2010:900 | 8 kap. 9 § | Tomtkrav — site must have parking usable by persons with reduced mobility |
| BFS 2024:13 | §§ 5–6 | Precise requirements for accessible parking spaces |

## Accessible Parking (Handikapparkering / HC-parkering)

| Rule | Value | Type | Applies to |
|------|-------|------|------------|
| Min accessible parking spaces | **≥1** space must be possible to arrange | Krav | All new construction on accessible plots |
| Location | On the plot (tomten) or in nära anslutning (close proximity) | Krav | All buildings |
| Nära anslutning | Adjacent plot or public space | Krav | If on-site not possible |
| Usability | Independently usable by person with mobility impairment (can enter/exit vehicle + reach path to building) | Krav | HC parking spaces |

### Applicability
| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| New construction on unbuilt plot | Full requirement applies |
| Existing plot | Requirement applies only to skälig extent (reasonable extent) |
| Terrain-inaccessible plot | Exemption |
| Fritidshus (holiday homes) | Exemption |
| Certain verkslokaler (work premises) | Exemption |

## HC Parking Dimensions

> The scraped page refers to "dimensionerande mått" (dimensioning measurements) per standard — specific mm dimensions were not stated on the page. Standard SS 12 41 50 / Transportstyrelsen guidelines typically specify:

| Parameter | Typical value | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Min width of HC space | **3,60 m** (often 5,0 m total with transfer zone) | Standard practice |
| Length | **5,0–6,0 m** | Standard |
| Aisle width behind HC space | **3,6 m** min | For manoeuvring |
| Transfer zone | **1,5 m** on side | Allows door opening + wheelchair transfer |
| HC signage | Per Transportstyrelsen | TSFS regulation |

> **Note**: Confirm exact dimensions against current Transportstyrelsen / SS standard — the Boverket page was qualitative.

## Parking Quantity (Antal parkeringsplatser)

Parking quantities are NOT set by national rules — they are determined by:
1. **Detaljplan** (local development plan) — the municipality sets parking ratios
2. **PBL 8 kap. 9 §** — requires "sufficient parking" for the building use
3. **Municipal parking norms** (parkeringsnormer) — each municipality publishes its own

Typical Swedish municipal parking norms (for reference only — verify locally):
| Use | Typical range |
|-----|--------------|
| Apartments (bostäder) | 0.5–1.0 spaces/apartment |
| Offices | 1 space/30–50 m² |
| Retail | 1 space/20–30 m² |
| HC spaces | ≥2% of total, min 1 |

## Cycle Parking (Cykelparkeringsplatser)

> Boverket's new rules (BFS 2024:13) also include requirements for bicycle parking. Not fully scraped — consult the full regulation for exact requirements.

## Notes

- PBL 8:9 requirement is about tomtkrav (site design), not the parking space construction itself
- "Nära anslutning" can mean an adjacent public parking facility if the municipality accepts it
- The HC space must allow the person to reach the main entrance path unassisted
- Gradient of route from HC space to building: follows ramp rules (max 1:12, see accessibility reference)
